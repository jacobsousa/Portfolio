# Portfolio CSS Assignment 

Portfolio containing place holder content until I have built more coding projects to hold. Currently the page is populated with my photography - about me copy still being drafted. This edit I've updated the CSS and created better flex properties and image sizing is now under control. 

<img src = ".portfolio/Portfolio/image1.png">
<img src= ".portfolio/Portfolio/image2.png">
